**Release log on GScri**

Fourth Iteration(29/04/2023)-
>[NEW] Prompts user to add new GCODE after each computation.
>[NEW] Added pos & orientation based on DH matrix compuation.

---------------

Third Iteration(18/04/2023)-
>[NEW] Improved look to Console Application.
>[NEW] Adding necessary details to readme file to explain on the application use in Github.

>[SOLVED] Console immediate crashing is now resolved. Alert on close_window event is enabled.

---------------

Second Iteration(28/03/2023)-
>[NEW] User is now able to convert G0 & G1 codes to its respective UR Script commands.
>[NEW] By default unit is set to millimeters. Since no additional Gcodes are taken in rx, ry, rz are kept as zero.
>[NEW] An exe(console based) for the team to understand how the GCODE conversion algorithm works in the project.
>[NEW] By default unit is set to millimeters. User will be able to change the unit by switching G20 and G21 commands in the final application.

>[SOLVED] If any of the coordinates is missing, iteration is now successfully completes which creates problem only if E or F is with G0/G1.

>[ISSUE] User defined GCODE converion not yet added.
>[ISSUE] Console closes immediately after the execuition where user is left with no results.
>[ISSUE] Feed rate and Extrusion Speed is not enabled.
>[ISSUE] Executable not able to install because of Windows Secuirity scan.

First Iteration(17/03/2023)
>[NEW] A statis GCode was successfully converted to movel movej commands based on the GCode with fixed speed and accelaration.

>[ISSUE] If any of the coordinates is missing, iteration failed which creates problem only if E or F is with G0/G1.
